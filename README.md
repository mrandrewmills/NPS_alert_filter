This PowerShell script filters **National Park Service (NPS) alerts** by a user-provided keyword, matching against alert titles and descriptions. It automatically downloads and caches the latest alert data from the [NPS API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/api-documentation.htm#/alerts/getAlerts), refreshing it daily.

## 📌 Features

* 🔄 Downloads the latest alert data from the official NPS API (two calls: metadata + full data)
* �� Caches data locally to avoid repeated downloads
* 🔍 Case-insensitive keyword search in title and description
* 🏝 Displays alert details including park name, category, alert dates, and link
* 🗽 Graceful error handling for connectivity and data issues
* 🔑 API key is read from an environment variable `NPS_API_KEY` for security

## 📁 Requirements

* PowerShell 5.1+ (Windows) or PowerShell Core 7+ (macOS/Linux)
* NPS API key stored in the environment variable `NPS_API_KEY`

```powershell
# Temporary for current session:
$env:NPS_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Permanent (User-level):
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("NPS_API_KEY", "YOUR_API_KEY", "User")
```

## 🚀 Usage

```powershell
.\AlertFilter.ps1 fire
```
